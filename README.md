# DEDLoc
**D**eep **E**arthquake **D**uctile **Loc**alization is a collection of codes to model ductile localization by thermal runaway. The models use simple shear boundary conditions and a composite visco-elastic rheology with diffusion creep, dislocation creep, low-temperature plasticity, and a viscosity regularization.
